    <h2>Question of the day: "what does responsive web design solve?"</h2>

    <div class="p2"> 

<br>
As most people live extremely busy lives and spend more time away from home, it is becoming clear that more people are accessing the internet from various types of  mobile devices around the world.As a result, the way we look at websites has changed and this means that how we think about how we present information to the user visually and technically (for lack of a better word) has also changed.
  
<br>
First of all, the design process has changed. I think years ago, it was assumed that  most users were using a standard (desktop) device and thus some assumptions could be made on how pages were being viewed.
  
<br>
Secondly, how a website is structured has changed over time. Now, in order for pages to be “user friendly” and guarantee the return of a customer, pages and navigation need to be easier to understand and perhaps more intuitive.
They way information is presented and whether it is clear and slow can also be solved with responsive design.

<br>
Also, how a site is planned can be made easier through responsive  design. It  can help cut down some unnecessary items and focus on essentials in order for users to access it easier and quicker on smaller devices.

I think overall responsive design helps reach a larger audience and  helps improve experiences while improving opportunities for those who do not have the same accessibility as others.
